# pyorientdb_ops
Pyorient has very limited operations when it comes to executing commands on to the orientdb database Since the pyorient is only supported for Orient DB versions below 3.0, I decided to post my code up to create these commands and interfaces to make it easier to use orientdb through python.

I extend the class from the pyorient, OrientDB class and create queries and executors.

I am not very pythonic PEP-8 oriented and would definitely love help in doing this in a more pythonic way.
